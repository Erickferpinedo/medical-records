How should this medicine be used

You can inject adalimumab injection anywhere on the front of your thighs or stomach except your navel and the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around it
To reduce the chances of soreness or redness, use a different site for each injection
Give each injection at least 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) away from a spot that you have already used

Drug: Zolpidem
Side Effects:
Zolpidem is used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep)
Zolpidem belongs to a class of medications called sedative-hypnotics
It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep
How should this medicine be used
You will probably become very sleepy soon after you take zolpidem and will remain sleepy for some time after you take the medication
Plan to go to bed right after you take zolpidem tablets, extended-release tablets, sublingual tablets (Edluar), and oral spray and to stay in bed for 7 to 8 hours
Take zolpidem sublingual tablets (Intermezzo) only when you are already in bed and can remain in bed for at least 4 more hours
Do not take zolpidem if you will be unable to remain asleep for the required number of hours after taking the medication
If you get up too soon after taking zolpidem, you may experience drowsiness and problems with memory, alertness, or coordination
Do not open the pouch that contains the sublingual tablet (Intermezzo) until you are ready to take the tablet
To remove the sublingual tablet (Edluar) from the blister pack, peel off the top layer of paper and push the tablet through the foil
To take either brand of sublingual tablet, place the tablet under your tongue, and wait for it to dissolve
Do not swallow the tablet whole or take the tablet with water
To use the oral spray, follow these directions and those that appear in the package label:
Before using zolpidem spray for the first time, or if you have not used the spray bottle for 14 days, you must prime the pump
Line up the arrows on the cap and the base of the container
Squeeze the cap at the arrows and pull the cap and base apart to separate
Remove the clear protective cap from the pump
To prime the pump, hold the container upright
Point the black spray opening away from your face and other people
Press down on the pump with your forefinger, release and let it return to the starting position and repeat 4 more times
You should see a fine spray come out of the container
To use zolpidem spray, hold the container upright with the black spray opening pointed directly into your mouth, over the top of your tongue
Press down fully on the pump to make sure that a full dose of zolpidem is sprayed
Snap the child-resistant cap back onto the base and rotate the cap and base so that the arrows are not lined up
This is to help prevent a child from using the spray mist bottle
Your sleep problems should improve within 7 to 10 days after you start taking zolpidem.

You should not apply any testosterone topical products to your penis or scrotum or to skin that has sores, cuts, or irritation
Testosterone gel and solution may catch fire
Stay away from open flames and do not smoke while you are applying testosterone topical and until the gel or solution has dried completely
To use testosterone topical products, follow these steps:
Be sure that the skin in the place where you plan to apply testosterone topical is clean and completely dry
Open your testosterone topical container

If you are using an Androgel® or Volgelxo® pump for the first time, press down on the top of the pump three times
If you are using a Fortesta® pump for the first time, press down on the top of the pump eight times

Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children
Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom)
Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them
However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet
Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program
